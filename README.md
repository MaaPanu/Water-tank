# Water-tank
This personal project is based on shallow water equations (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shallow_water_equations) where height and wind are extrapolated in time using leap-frog method. The animation is executed with use of plt.animation.FuncAnimation
So far the initialized scenario is pillar of fluid collapsing in the middle and therfore causing motion. In future I might add rebound boundary condition and some other initial condition for height.
